# Unit 13 MVC Homework: # Node Express Handlebars

## Description

This is a full stack crud application meant to be for fun. This application allows the user to interact with the database by updating a boolean value in mysql. When the user clicks on "hungry" or "not hungry" buttons, the value in mysql database is updated demonstrating the update in crud. The user can also add burgers which demonstrates the create in crud. Upon initial loading of the page, this demonstrates the read part in crud. The delete functionality was optional in this assignment, but will be added a later time.
